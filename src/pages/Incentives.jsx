Effective cost over the lifetime for electric vehicles is still less. The government offers different types of financial incentives to make electric vehicles more affordable for you. The key mechanisms for getting incentives are:</div>
      <div> </div>

      <div>4. Road tax exemption:Road tax at the time of purchase is waived off</div>
      <div>5. Registration fee exemption:One-time registration fee applicable on new vehicle purchase is waived off</div>
      <div>6. Income tax benefit: Provided as a deduction on the tax amount payable by an individual to the government</div>
