    'Electric Vehicle' : [
        {question : 'What is an Electric Vehicle?', answer : 'An electric vehicle (EV) is a vehicle that is powered by an electric motor and a battery, which can be recharged by plugging it into a fast-charging socket and a standard electrical socket as well.'},
        {question : 'Do Electric Vehicles drive differently to conventional vehicles?', answer : 'An electric car is silent, with the sound of running motor audible only at high speeds. Aside from that, electric vehicles are relatively easy to operate and drive like a conventional car with an automatic transmission. But, unlike an automatic, they have a lot of torque from a standstill, making them incredibly responsive.'},
        {question : 'How can I get more range out of my electric vehicle?', answer : 'There could be several factors that impact the range of an electric vehicle. Internal elements such as the use of air conditioning and/or heating are among them. Driving style can also have a substantial impact, with greater speeds and rapid acceleration reducing the available range dramatically.Making excellent use of regenerative braking can also help to slow down the rate at which your batterys charge depletes, and the outside temperature has an effect as well, with batteries preferring warm to cold temperatures.'},
        {question : 'Does my electric vehicle need service and maintenance?', answer : 'While your electric vehicle functioning reflects your driving patterns and weather, electric vehicles require less maintenance than conventional vehicles because: The battery, motor, and related electronics require little to no regular maintenance There are fewer fluids that require routine maintenance, such as engine oil.Regenerative braking reduces brake wear substantially. In comparison to a traditional conventional vehicle engine, there are much less moving parts.'},
        {question : 'How do I know the battery needs replacement?', answer : 'When you start your car with a low battery, you may notice that the engine spins over slowly than usual and that the dash lights flicker or dim. Even if the battery is completely charged after driving, this can happen. Another symptom is that once the engine has been shut off, the power windows move much slower than when the engine is operating. When the vehicle is idling, you may also notice that the lights decrease, but brighten again when the engine is revved. Corrosion at the battery terminals and cables also indicates that the battery is deteriorating.'},

    'Electric Vehicle Charging' : [
        {question : 'How much does it cost to charge an electric vehicle on public charging locations?', answer : 'The cost of charging an electric vehicle at a public charging station varies substantially based on the amount of charge necessary, the cost of power in each network, and the type of public charging station utilized. Some will cost very less to use, whereas quick/rapid charging will often be more expensive than fast charging due to the convenience and greater capital costs.'},
        {question : 'How many public electric vehicle charge points are there in India?', answer : 'When you need to charge while on the road, you’ll find 934 stations in India available to the public. The number is steadily increasing with new devices getting installed by different players, both public and private players.'},

    'Safety' : [
        {question : 'Is charging an Electric vehicle in the rain dangerous?', answer : 'Because we know that water carries energy, people are afraid about charging an electric vehicle in the rain. Electric car chargers, on the other hand, are weatherproof and designed to protect both the car and its occupants from electrical shock. Electric car chargers are also put through thorough testing and must fulfil certain safety standards. Additionally, waterproofing electrical connectors, as well as any other electrical equipment, is quite common.'},
        {question : 'Does cold weather affect battery performance?', answer : 'Cold temperatures have a detrimental impact on a batterys performance as well as its capacity to receive a charge. Regenerative braking, which recovers energy lost during deceleration or halting and transfers it back to the battery, is similarly limited by cold temperatures. Simply put, when the temperatures drop, youll travel fewer miles, and charging the vehicle will take longer.'},
        {question : 'Does the battery catch fire at high temperatures?', answer : 'The battery life of your electric vehicle can be shortened by hot weather. High temperatures can cause the lithium-ion batteries found in electric vehicles to lose charge, just as they would if you left your phone out in the sun for too long. Extreme temperatures are known to drain more battery power from your electric car, especially in the heat, which might cause the device to overheat and consume more energy than usual. So, if you can drive the lengthier segments of your route while the weather is cooler, youll be able to maximise the range of your electric vehicle.'},
        {question : 'Are electric vehicles safe in an accident?', answer : '"Intrinsically safe" electric vehicles are required. Its crucial to remember that all electric automobiles must adhere to the same stringent design and manufacturing standards as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Essentially, they go through the same procedure, with an extensive focus on making these vehicles as secure as possible. As soon as a flaw is identified, the batterys power flow is turned off. In the event of an accident, the battery is instantly isolated from all other high-voltage components and cables. Therefore, Electric Vehicles are as safe as any other petrol or diesel vehicles.'},
        {question : 'Is battery swapping a viable alternative re-fueling option?', answer : 'Battery swapping provides a method of decoupling of batteries from EVs and reducing their upfront costs. It also ensures reduced waiting / charging time for vehicles and offers a promising alternative to increase the adoption of EVs in commercial segment.'},
        {question : 'Can lithium and other materials contained in the EV batteries be recycled?', answer : 'Yes. The vast majority of today’s lithium-ion batteries are recycled. Recycling of batteries reduces negative environmental impact as well as has the potential to reduce the overall cost of a battery.'},
