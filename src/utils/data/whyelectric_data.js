Electric vehicles charge their batteries with electricity rather than using fossil fuels such as petrol or diesel. Evs are more efficient, which even when combined with the cost of electricity. They have much lower maintenance costs than internal combustion vehicles because they have fewer moving parts. Electric vehicles require less maintenance than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. As a result, the annual cost of operating an electric vehicle is significantly lower.',
